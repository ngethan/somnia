## What is Somnia?

Somnia turns healthy sleep habits into a fun, competitive experience. Users can track their sleep scores and see how they rank among friends on a leaderboard. This unique keeps users motivated to maintain healthy habits over a long period of time. Beyond individual tracking, Somnia fosters community through friendly competition. This social interaction keeps users invested, making the app not just a sleep tracker but a platform for bonding over wellness. The app provides insights into usersâ€™ sleep patterns and their correlation to metrics like resting heart rate. The combination of these metrics into a sleep score helps users understand how small changes in their sleep improve overall health.
